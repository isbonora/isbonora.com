        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          The Reflection Flag was developed in collaboration with the BMW Group
          and Idealworks from Munich, Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
          This industry-linked project led by the Idealworks‚Äô design team,
          enabled an advanced discovery process into how warehouse workers
          interact with autonomous mobile robots (AMR) in the manufacturing
          environment. Enabling a unique learning experience, interviewing
          professionals in their field outside of my normal design practice and
          experience.

          Research identified a need for observers of an AMR to be able to
          understand what the robot is ‚Äúthinking‚Äù and be able to better predict
          its movements so that humans in the same space as AMR‚Äôs may work more
          harmoniously.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
          The Reflection Flag addresses the research findings by providing a
          peripheral device to AMR‚Äôs that offers real time feedback to users and
          observers around the AMR‚Äôs local space. The mast head takes in
          existing LiDAR information and reflects back the AMR‚Äôs perception to
          the observer through the use of an 360 degree LED matrix. Mimicking
          the user‚Äôs position relative to the AMR on the LED matrix as a method
          of understanding. This displayed understanding allows users local to
          the AMR to work more efficiently where there are now clear
          expectations that the robot sees the user and that they can expect it
          to behave normally. In addition to the reflection function of the
          peripheral, an interface in the centre of the mast allows for manual
          override of the AMR without the need for external equipment.

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
          While healthcare professionals express their intentions to be
          sustainable, the reality is that the industry heavily relies on a
          pay-per-use model, resulting in the disposal of large volumes of
          single-use instruments. This wasteful approach is particularly
          prominent in smaller practices, where sustainable alternatives are
          deemed too expensive and time-consuming, exacerbating the issue of
          excess waste.

            Extracted from Infection prevention and control standards: for
            general practices and other office-based and community-based

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Traditionally, autoclaves have been the gold standard for
          sterilisation in the medical industry. However, their high cost, space
          requirements, and inefficiency for smaller practices have limited
          their accessibility and effectiveness. The modClave revolutionises
          waste management practices by providing an affordable and compact
          solution for clinics that are currently priced out of sustainability.

      <Section>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
          By enabling small to medium-sized medical practices to reprocess
          reusable instruments such as scissors, tweezers, and forceps, the
          modClave effectively addresses the pain points identified during the
          research phase. It alleviates the financial burden associated with
          traditional autoclaves, which have forced clinics to rely on
          single-use instruments that contribute to waste stream.

        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>
          With its potential to promote sustainable practices across various
          facets of the medical industry, the modClave represents a significant
          advancement in addressing waste mismanagement. This project has not
          only enhanced my skills as a graduate of industrial design has
          emphasised for myself the importance of addressing waste during
          product development and understanding the need to know explicitly what
          my users problems are.
