        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          The Reflection Flag was developed in collaboration with the BMW Group
          and Idealworks from Munich, Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
          This industry-linked project led by the Idealworks‚Äô design team,
          enabled an advanced discovery process into how warehouse workers
          interact with autonomous mobile robots (AMR) in the manufacturing
          environment. Enabling a unique learning experience, interviewing
          professionals in their field outside of my normal design practice and
          experience.

          Research identified a need for observers of an AMR to be able to
          understand what the robot is ‚Äúthinking‚Äù and be able to better predict
          its movements so that humans in the same space as AMR‚Äôs may work more
          harmoniously.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
          The Reflection Flag addresses the research findings by providing a
          peripheral device to AMR‚Äôs that offers real time feedback to users and
          observers around the AMR‚Äôs local space. The mast head takes in
          existing LiDAR information and reflects back the AMR‚Äôs perception to
          the observer through the use of an 360 degree LED matrix. Mimicking
          the user‚Äôs position relative to the AMR on the LED matrix as a method
          of understanding. This displayed understanding allows users local to
          the AMR to work more efficiently where there are now clear
          expectations that the robot sees the user and that they can expect it
          to behave normally. In addition to the reflection function of the
          peripheral, an interface in the centre of the mast allows for manual
          override of the AMR without the need for external equipment.

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          The peripheral works as an effective tool to improve satisfaction and
          reduce chances of accidents in the workplace. Through the use of
          mimicry in the LED matrix, and swift manual override in the handle,
          the Reflection Flag has clear benefits for any AMR found in
          warehouses.
