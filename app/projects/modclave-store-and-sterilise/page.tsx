          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p className="leading-loose">
            The modClave, a module-based steam sterilisation desktop appliance, is
            a groundbreaking solution that addresses the issues of waste
            mismanagement and sustainability in the healthcare industry. Developed
            through extensive research involving healthcare professionals in
            south-east Queensland, the modClave tackles the prevalent problem of
            excessive waste generated by poor waste practices.

          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p className="leading-loose">
            While healthcare professionals express their intentions to be
            sustainable, the reality is that the industry heavily relies on a
            pay-per-use model, resulting in the disposal of large volumes of
            single-use instruments. This wasteful approach is particularly
            prominent in smaller practices, where sustainable alternatives are
            deemed too expensive and time-consuming, exacerbating the issue of
            excess waste.

          <p className="leading-loose">
            Traditionally, autoclaves have been the gold standard for
            sterilisation in the medical industry. However, their high cost, space
            requirements, and inefficiency for smaller practices have limited
            their accessibility and effectiveness. The modClave revolutionises
            waste management practices by providing an affordable and compact
            solution for clinics that are currently priced out of sustainability.

          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p className="leading-loose">
            By enabling small to medium-sized medical practices to reprocess reusable instruments such as scissors, tweezers, and forceps, the modClave effectively addresses the pain points identified during the research phase. It alleviates the financial burden associated with traditional autoclaves, which have forced clinics to rely on single-use instruments that contribute to waste stream.

          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p className="leading-loose">
            With its potential to promote sustainable practices across various facets of the medical industry, the modClave represents a significant advancement in addressing waste mismanagement. This project has not only enhanced my skills as a graduate of industrial design has emphasised for myself the importance of addressing waste during product development and understanding the need to know explicitly what my users problems are.
