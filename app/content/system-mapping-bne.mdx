## Introduction

With this markup you can obtain _simple emhpasis_ (usually rendered in italic text), **strong emphasis** (usually rendered in bold text), `source code` text (usually rendered in monospaced text), or ~~strikethrough~~ text (usually rendered with a line through text).

You may use also _this_ or **this** notation to emphatize text, and you can use all them _**`together`**_ (and you can mix `*` and `_` )

If you look at the source code you may note that
even
if
you
break
the
lines,
the text is kept together
in a single paragraph

Paragraphs are delimited by blank lines, leading and trailing spaces are removed

You may force a line break with two spaces  
or with a `\`\
at the end of the lin

There are two ways to define headers:

# The biggest possible header

# You can also use this markup

(I prefer the first one as it's more readable when looking directly at the source code)

## A sub heading

## This is the alternative format

### Then you can go smaller

#### And smaller

##### And even smaller

###### No, you can't go smaller than this

The good thing is that many tools that convert Markdown in HTML or PDF are able to generate the index of your document, or links to the headers automatically (like Github does on the [source](http://git.io/vfz98) of Markdown files)
