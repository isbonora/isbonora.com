## Introduction

The Reflection Flag was developed in collaboration with the BMW Group
and Idealworks from Munich, Germany.

This industry-linked project led by the Idealworks‚Äô design team,
enabled an advanced discovery process into how warehouse workers
interact with autonomous mobile robots (AMR) in the manufacturing
environment. Enabling a unique learning experience, interviewing
professionals in their field outside of my normal design practice and
experience.

    Research identified a need for observers of an AMR to be able to understand
    what the robot is ‚Äúthinking‚Äù and be able to better predict its movements so
    that humans in the same space as AMR‚Äôs may work more harmoniously.

## Solution

The Reflection Flag addresses the research findings by providing a
peripheral device to AMR‚Äôs that offers real time feedback to users and
observers around the AMR‚Äôs local space. The mast head takes in
existing LiDAR information and reflects back the AMR‚Äôs perception to
the observer through the use of an 360 degree LED matrix. Mimicking
the user‚Äôs position relative to the AMR on the LED matrix as a method
of understanding. This displayed understanding allows users local to
the AMR to work more efficiently where there are now clear
expectations that the robot sees the user and that they can expect it
to behave normally. In addition to the reflection function of the
peripheral, an interface in the centre of the mast allows for manual
override of the AMR without the need for external equipment.

      },
    ]}
  />

## Summary

The peripheral works as an effective tool to improve satisfaction and
reduce chances of accidents in the workplace. Through the use of
mimicry in the LED matrix, and swift manual override in the handle,
the Reflection Flag has clear benefits for any AMR found in
warehouses.
