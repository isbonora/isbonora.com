# Introduction

Living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) can be challenging, especially when it comes to managing daily medical procedures. As someone who has experienced loved ones with T1D, I am able to sympathise with the emotional and behavioral problems that often arise with traditional diabetic care products.

# The DiCart Concept

DiCart is not just a product; it's a vision that seeks to empower individuals managing diabetes with thoughtful and sensitive experiences. Our mission is twofold: to provide products and services that accommodate the needs of T1D patients and to eliminate the public stigma surrounding their daily medical rituals.

# Understanding the Problem

The DiCart project was born out of a deep understanding of the relationship between people with T1D and their chronic condition. Existing literature has highlighted the impact of social-environmental factors on how young individuals manage chronic illnesses. Maintaining glycemic goals is crucial for long-term health, but the emotional toll of managing T1D can lead to anti-social behavior due to perceived judgment by peers.

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, there are 1.3 million people in Australia with diabetes, and 1 in 5 of them have T1D. This significant number indicates that there is a substantial portion of the population actively managing T1D with insulin. However, many existing products fail to be sensitive to the user's needs during vulnerable moments when maintaining glycemic goals is paramount.

# Introducing the DiCart Solution

DiCart is an all-encompassing solution that addresses the identified social behavior issues and seamlessly integrates into people's lives without external judgment. It consists of two primary components:

## 1. The DiCart Kit

The DiCart kit is a physical product that offers a sensitive and discreet experience for T1D patients. It includes a set of single-use needle cartridges for insulin, which are color-coded to categorize the different types of insulin. This intuitive design ensures that users can quickly identify the correct cartridge without drawing attention to their medical needs.

## 2. The DiCart Smartphone App

The DiCart platform also includes a user-friendly smartphone app that communicates with active blood-glucose monitoring systems. The app provides timely reminders for upcoming injection times, ensuring that users never miss a critical moment for managing their condition effectively.

# The Seamless Experience

The synergy between the DiCart kit and the smartphone app creates a seamless experience for users. When it's time for an injection, the app sends a discreet notification to the user's wearables or smartphone, indicating the appropriate color-coded cartridge to use. The system uses intelligent predictive models to offer suggestions based on eating habits and glucose intake, ensuring that the user is always informed and supported in their diabetes management journey.

Users have the flexibility to accept the app's recommendation or momentarily ignore it, depending on their situation. The inconspicuous design of the cartridges enables users to perform medical procedures in public without feeling self-conscious or having to isolate themselves.
