  This project was completed over 12-months in the final year of my
          Industrial Design degree as my disertation project. The projects
          outcome incluced a reserach thesis and a developed product based on
          the reserach completed in the first 6 months of the project.

## Introduction

The modClave, a module-based steam sterilisation desktop appliance, is
a groundbreaking solution that addresses the issues of waste
mismanagement and sustainability in the healthcare industry. Developed
through extensive research involving healthcare professionals in
south-east Queensland, the modClave tackles the prevalent problem of
excessive waste generated by poor waste practices.

## Problem

While healthcare professionals express their intentions to be
sustainable, the reality is that the industry heavily relies on a
pay-per-use model, resulting in the disposal of large volumes of
single-use instruments. This wasteful approach is particularly
prominent in smaller practices, where sustainable alternatives are
deemed too expensive and time-consuming, exacerbating the issue of
excess waste.

    Traditionally, autoclaves have been the gold standard for sterilisation in
    the medical industry. However, their high cost, space requirements, and
    inefficiency for smaller practices have limited their accessibility and
    effectiveness. The modClave revolutionises waste management practices by
    providing an affordable and compact solution for clinics that are currently
    priced out of sustainability.

## Solution

By enabling small to medium-sized medical practices to reprocess
reusable instruments such as scissors, tweezers, and forceps, the
modClave effectively addresses the pain points identified during the
research phase. It alleviates the financial burden associated with
traditional autoclaves, which have forced clinics to rely on
single-use instruments that contribute to waste stream.

## Outcome

With its potential to promote sustainable practices across various
facets of the medical industry, the modClave represents a significant
advancement in addressing waste mismanagement. This project has not
only enhanced my skills as a graduate of industrial design has
emphasised for myself the importance of addressing waste during
product development and understanding the need to know explicitly what
my users problems are.
